Today, the graphic design profession thrives in the Pacific Northwest after rising in prominence over the last 30 years. Throughout the latter part of the 20th century, graphic design rapidly transitioned from the illustration-based world of advertising to a practice with its own identity. European modernists helped influence this new way of designing, and as this approach began to take hold in key European cities, it soon spread to the Americas in New York, Chicago, Brazil and Canada. In Seattle and Portland these ripples were much smaller, though just as strongly felt by a small group of like-minded designers.
