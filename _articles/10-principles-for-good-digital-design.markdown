In 1983 acclaimed and influential industrial designer Deiter Rams coined ten principles for good design. Seeing a shift towards a consumeristic mindset and a flood of products with built in obsolescence reaching a dangerous level that stood at odds what what intuitively one should expect and design in a product. The opposite, would be something conceived intelligently and made to last, and was in tune with Ram’s own ethos. 

These principles are as follows:

1 – Good design is innovative
2 – Good design makes a product useful
3 – Good design is aesthetic
4 – Good design makes a product understandable
5 – Good design is unobtrusive
6 – Good design is honest
7 – Good design is long-lasting
8 – Good design is thorough down to the last detail
9 – Good design is environmentally friendly
10 – Good design is as little design as possible

For us at Rationale, we find these as relevant and resonant today as ever. 
While these principles were conceived for physical industrial design, we find them as equality relevant and needed for landscape of digital products, where the intent behind them often is as mal-intended in purpose as that of the physical products aforementioned that spawned these principles.

With our new iPhone app Minimal Calendar, these principles were taken to heart. The design that started in 2013 is the same design we shipped in 2018. Good design is design built to last. 

Here are ways we looked at these principles as it related to our app:
1 – Good design is innovative
