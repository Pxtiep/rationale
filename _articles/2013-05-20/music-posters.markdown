Weâ€™ve collected a series of our concert posters designed for The Fascination Movement and other select artists over the last several years. Each employs a variety of focused visual devices: geometric shapes, primary colors, and strong, simple typography.

The result is set of posters that, in their simplicity, call attention to themselves in the visually cluttered landscape of music promotions.
