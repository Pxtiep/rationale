We have collected a series of concert posters designed for The Fascination Movement and other select artists over the last several years. Each employs a variety of focused visual devices: strong, simple typography; geometric shapes; primary colors. 

The result is set of posters that, in their simplicity, call attention to theirselves in the visually cluttered landscape of music promotions.
