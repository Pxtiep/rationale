We are proud to present an exhibit of cultural Modernist design works curated from our archives. Includes original artifacts by Otl Aicher, Karl Gerstner, Carl B. Graf, Armin Hofmann, Toshihiro Katayama, Marcel Wyss, and more.

In partnership with Civilization, an exhibition like this is a Seattle first. While you've seen works like this online, it can't quite compare with the power and scale of the real thing. Come experience it in Seattle through March 23rd with an opening party happening from 6â€“9pm on February 21st.
