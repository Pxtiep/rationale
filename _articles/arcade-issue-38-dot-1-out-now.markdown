  I also created a new visual identity for ARCADE, who is Seattle’s longest running
  design and architecture publication for over 40 years and am happy to see this thinking
  in full effect in this issue which wouldn’t have been possible without my amazing
  co-editors Lauren Gallow and Jocelyn Beausire.

I’m pleased to announce the new issue of ARCADE magazine I designed is now available free online digitally or printed at [arcadenw.org](http://www.arcadenw.org). I also created a new visual identity for ARCADE, who is Seattle’s longest running design and architecture publication for over 40 years and am happy to see this thinking in full effect in this issue which wouldn’t have been possible without my amazing co-editors Lauren Gallow and Jocelyn Beausire.

PHASE SHIFT explores the concept of death in the built & designed environment, with articles on Katrina Spade’s Recompose, Seattle’s new AIDS Memorial Pathway, Cynthia Brothers and Vanishing Seattle, John Akomfrah, and so much more.
