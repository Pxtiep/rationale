Limited-edition poster designed by Sean Wolcott of Rationale. Giclée printed at A1 large format size on enhanced matte paper with deep and vibrant colors. Signed and numbered on back by the designer. Shipped in a heavy-duty mailing tube ready to be framed or hung as is.

Instead of the usual graphics, we reenvisioned the Hot Rod & Classic Car Show in historic Snohomish, Washington, USA to direct focus to the beauty of cars’ details themselves. The close-up photography is paired with a bold typographic treatment that entices one to come and “See More” at the annual event.
