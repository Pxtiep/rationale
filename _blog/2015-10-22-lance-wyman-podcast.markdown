This Saturday, October 24th, 5-7 PM at Peter Miller Books in Seattle attend an exclusive recording of the "Beyond This Point" podcast on branding, graphic design history and print featuring Lance Wyman, Rationale's Sean Wolcott, Adrian Shaughnessy, and Peter Miller. Moderated by Civilization.

I am very honored to have this chance to be on stage chatting with such design legends.
