The cover imagery for the novel “So Far Out to Sea” takes a geometric, abstract representation of the book, creating intrigue in its relation to specific aspects of the story: The blue of the ocean and black of space. The rift between social classes. Earth and the watchful reach of the telescope to the other end of the solar system. These elements are applied across various promotional materials for the novel.
