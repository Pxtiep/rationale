This invitation for a local artisan craft fair is printed on a heavy kraft paper. While the kraft paper is consistent from year to year, the use of a solid or light background changes, as does the typography and the phrase the invitation features.

Varying the use of one color and two typefaces in inventive ways creates a great variety of possibilities for future invitations while maintaining a recognizable identity.
