How does one convey the nuance, history, and diversity of wine culture in a simple visual means? Corks, bottles on a rack, a cluster of grapesâ€”such concepts provide a compelling way to represent the range of its culture and craft for wine liaison Bryan Kennedy.

With bold and elegant simplicity, the bright red ink against white conveys the colors of wine. A prominent mark sits positioned in the center of the design; it is ambiguous but is sure of its subject: grapes, bottles, variety. The typographic treatment is straightforward and strong, mixing classic and contemporary forms across various stationery materials.
