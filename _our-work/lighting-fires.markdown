Lighting Fires is a book concept about digital and social media strategy and growth. Its identity design is applied to the book cover format, interior pages, promotional materials, and website visuals.

The design, a sequential geometry-inspired interpretation of fire as a digital abstraction, conveys the notion of this growth of ideas and the scale of a digital presence over time.
