For the second annual The Book Was Better Film Festival, in which people submit a short film based on one chapter from a book, Rationale created an identity program that can be taken in new directions for years to come while maintaining a clear image.

Many visual metaphors can signify film, but most of these are too referential to the previous, analog era. The solution here achieves something more universal and transcendent: Transitioning groups of lines suggest the transitioning frames of a movie as well as the turning pages of a book. Through this abstraction also comes the ability to convey many other concepts at once—the light and lack of light that composes a film, as well as a book’s inverse (the white of a page of paper and the black of ink).
