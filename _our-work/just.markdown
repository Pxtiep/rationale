For food company Just, a visual identity was created to address a wide array of
products and communications for years to come. A foundation of bold colors
and the consideration of food and the craftsmanship that goes into it inspires
a diverse and consistent execution. This is articulated through flavors, products, websites, and more in a way that stands out with its straightforwardness and unique photo-graphical combination, providing an approach that stands unique next to the typical over-stylized or pseudo-natural appearance of other food brands.
