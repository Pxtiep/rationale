Instead of the usual graphics, we reenvisioned the Hot Rod & Classic Car Show in historic Snohomish, Washington, USA to direct focus to the beauty of cars’ details themselves.

The close-up photography is paired with a bold typographic treatment that entices one to come and “See More” at the annual event.
