Instead of the usual graphics, the Hot Rod & Classic Car Show in historic Snohomish, Washington, USA has been re-envisioned to bring focus on the beauty the details of the cars themselves.


The close-up photography is paired with a bold and simple typographic treatment which gives greater impact and entices one to come and "See More" at the annual event.
