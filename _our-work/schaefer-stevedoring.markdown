In the space of transport, particularly for the maritime industry, there is an overwhelming richness of history and metaphors to embrace. As such, a maritime company’s visual identity has great opportunity to distinguish itself from competitors as superior and state-of-the-art. This was our goal with the identity we developed for Schaefer Stevedoring.

The family and company name of Schaefer provided a clear path to an appropriate solution: Schaefer is a visually pleasing word that has been made even more distinctive with the combined ligature of the lowercase “ae” and the removed left cross-bar of “f”. This, rendered in a medium-bold weight sans-serif typeface, leaves a clear mark that can extend across existing and future company groups in powerful ways.

The symbol itself becomes equally important and is a way to unify Schaefer and all companies that it may represent. The symbol possesses a great power in its immense simplicity—one which reflects the Schaefer “S,” the turning of a wheel, a ship’s wheel, a steel coil, forward motion, trading between north and south, storage, strength, cargo containers, and other related metaphors, all of which are revealed in the symbol’s abstraction. This mark is unique and rich with imagery in a way that is rarely achievable with such simplicity, and can become a powerful tool in representing the company into the future. 

These elements are used with the colors of royal blue (representing the sea and the flag of Texas) and grey (representing steel). These, alongside many powerful expressions conveying the services Schaefer and its related companies provide, stand out from its competition in their modernity and embrace of thoughtful design.
