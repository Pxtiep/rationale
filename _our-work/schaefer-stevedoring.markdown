excerpt_text: In the space of transport, particularly for the maritime industry, there
  is an overwhelming richness of history and metaphors to embrace. As such, a maritime
  company’s visual identity has great opportunity to distinguish itself from competitors
  as superior and state-of-the-art. This was our goal with the identity and logomark
  we developed for Schaefer Stevedoring.
