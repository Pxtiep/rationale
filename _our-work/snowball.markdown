excerpt_text: EP cover designed for music group Square Frames. The concept of the
  cover takes the basic information of the music—the group’s name and the name of
  the EP, and converts it into a graphical composition of the intersection of a frame
  (Square Frame) and a sphere set against a cool blue (Snowball).
