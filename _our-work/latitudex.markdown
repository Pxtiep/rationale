Latitudex, an identity system for an IT services company, provides a unique and vibrant visual language that clearly differentiates the company from competitors.


Just as latitudinal lines wrap the globe, a continuous line wraps all Latitudex communications. This unbroken element, represents a direct line to the solution, as well as a promise to the customer. The primary system of yellow-orange color provides a bright and optimistic accent to all pieces.
